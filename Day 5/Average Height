'''write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164'''

# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
  
# Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡
num_student = len(student_heights) 
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(f'total height = {total_height}')

no_of_students = 0
for students in student_heights:
  no_of_students += 1
print(f'number of students = {no_of_students}')

Average_height = round(total_height/no_of_students)
